# Python (Part 4)
# Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. Pandas is defined as an open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation in Python. The name of Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data, which means an Econometrics from Multidimensional data. It is used for data analysis in Python and developed by Wes McKinney in 2008.
Pandas has 2 objects namely dataframe and series.
## Object Series
Object series have one data dimension. Do not have a column name because it only have one column and have an index.
- Implicit Index, implicit index is the default index. we can define an index called an explicit index and it must be equal to the number of data.
## loc() and iloc()
- loc() and iloc() are essential Pandas methods used for filtering, selecting, and manipulating data. They are quick, fast, easy to read, and sometimes interchangeable.
- loc() and iloc() method are used to overcome inconsistencies in calling data.
### loc() function
- The loc() function is label based (explicit index) data selecting method which means that we have to pass the name of the row or column which we want to select.
- This method includes the last element of the range passed in it.
- loc() can accept the boolean data unlike iloc().
### iloc() function
- The iloc() function is an indexed-based (implicit index) selecting method which means that we have to pass an integer index in the method to select a specific row/column.
- This method does not include the last element of the range passed in it.
- iloc() does not accept the boolean data unlike loc().

## DataFrame
- DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns
- DataFrames are similar to SQL tables or the spreadsheets that you work with in Excel or Calc. In many cases, DataFrames are faster, easier to use, and more powerful than tables or spreadsheets because theyâ€™re an integral part of the Python and NumPy ecosystems.
- DataFrames are widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and many other data-intensive fields.

## Data Preparation and Exploration
- Call the Dataset using data.read_csv()
- Show the data fro the top ot from the bottom using data.head() or data.tail()
- Display all the information about dataset using data,info()
- Check missing value and count it using data.isnull().sum()

## Exploration the Information in Data
- The number of rows using data.shape()
- The name of the columns using data.column()
- The index using data.index()
- Average using data.mean()
- Minimum and maximum value from the data using data.min() or data.max
- Mode of the data using data.mode()
- View the unique data from some column and know the count of it

## Data Visualization Using Python
Python offers several plotting libraries, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn and many other such data visualization packages with different features for creating informative, customized, and appealing plots to present data in the most simple and effective way.
### Matplotlib
- It is used for basic graph plotting like line charts, bar graphs, etc.
- It mainly works with datasets and arrays.
- Matplotlib acts productively with data arrays and frames. It regards the aces and figures as objects.
- Matplotlib is more customizable and pairs well with Pandas and Numpy for Exploratory Data Analysis.
### Seaborn
- It is mainly used for statistics visualization and can perform complex visualizations with fewer commands.
- It works with entire datasets.
- Seaborn is considerably more organized and functional than Matplotlib and treats the entire dataset as a solitary unit.
- Seaborn has more inbuilt themes and is mainly used for statistical analysis.

## Line Chart

A Line chart is a graph that represents information as a series of data points connected by a straight line. In line charts, each data point or marker is plotted and connected with a line or curve.

## Bar Chart

When you have categorical data, you can represent it with a bar graph. A bar graph plots data with the help of bars, which represent value on the y-axis and category on the x-axis. Bar graphs use bars with varying heights to show the data which belongs to a specific category.
